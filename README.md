# Search_engine
This semantic search engine is designed to go beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the meaning of text. It uses a SentenceTransformer model, such as all-MiniLM-L6-v2, to convert both the userâ€™s query and the collection of sentences (corpus) into high-dimensional vector embeddings.
